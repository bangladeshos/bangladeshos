## üßë‚Äçüíª  Open Source

The open-source ecosystem in Bangladesh is thriving with many contributors & maintainers from Bangladesh and open-source projects being built in Bangladesh. We are here to help developers, contributors and maintainers in their journey towards open-source.

### Projects from Bangladesh

There are many open-source projects that we might be using frequently, but unaware that it's a project that was created in or receiving significant contributions from Bangladesh. We have collated some of the projects from Bangladesh in this GitHub Explore Collection - [Made in Bangladesh](https://github.com/collections/made-in-bangladesh)

If you know of any other projects from Bangladesh, [Suggest an edit](https://github.com/github/explore/edit/main/collections/made-in-bangladesh/index.md?source=suggest-edits-made-in-bangladesh) and tag any one of the project's maintainers/admin in the comment of the PR.


### Resources

If you are looking to make your first contribution to open source, or even an experienced maintainer looking for ways to grow your community ‚Äî we have resources to help you! Check out the [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide) which has many resources on how to start an open-source project, build communities, best practices for maintainers, and a lot more!

There's no substitute for hands-on experience. But for most students, real-world tools can be cost-prohibitive.
